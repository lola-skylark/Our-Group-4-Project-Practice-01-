    <h4> Product Description and Elements of Design </h4> 
    <p> Our prototype is a heat generated flashlight, using body heat from the user as the main source of energy and the chemicals within as a back-up source. We realized that flashlights are generally powered by batteries, which are harmful to our environment. By creating a flashlight using heat to create light, it will be more environmentally friendly compared to the competing flashlights on the market. We noticed that there will be certain scenarios, where the body heat of the user might be too cold to provide enough energy to generate light, so we will have certain chemicals inside to help maintain a light source. Our product will be made out of a conductive material to allow heat conduction to generate energy, thus creating light. However, we noticed that there are situations where the user may want to hold the flashlight, but not necessarily want light, so we decided to create an on and off button that controls the flow of energy. Overall, we are aiming to create a flashlight that will mainly use the thermal energy from our bodies instead of batteries to build a durable product with the goal of reducing the potential waste of ordinary flashlights that are going into landfills after disposal and to indirectly eliminate the usage of batteries. </p>
