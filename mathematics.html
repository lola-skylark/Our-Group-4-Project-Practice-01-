      <h4> Modelling The Seebeck Effect Mathematically </h4> 
        <p> V = αΔT </p> 
          <ul> 
            <li> Where V is the voltage </li> 
            <li> Where α is the Seebeck coefficient (Different Metals Have Different Coefficients!) </li>
            <li> Where ΔT is the difference in temperature between the hot and cool ends of the two junctions </li> 
          </ul> 
  
      <h4> The Seebeck Coefficient </h4> 
        <ul> 
          <li> It is the amount of voltage produced between the two conductors when the temperature across them is sustained at 1 Kelvin (K). </li>
        </ul> 
  
      <h4> Calculating Temperature Differences </h4> 
        <p> V = a*(theta) + 1/2*b*(theta)^2 </p> 
          <ul>
            <li> Where V is the voltage. </li>
            <li> Where a and b are the seebeck coefficients which depend on the nature of the material. </li>
            <li> Where theta is the temperature difference between the two junctions. </li> 
          </ul>
